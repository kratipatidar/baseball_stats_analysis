I plotted different predictors versus the response. I saw a lot of overlap between the distributions. Here is an example of such a plot.

The other alternative to this is taking the difference and ratio of these predictors, and observing if these predictor plots offer any improvement over the previously obtained plots.

In my analysis, I observed that even the ratio and differences, for instance the SLG_home and SLG_diff plots had significant overlap between them.

This plot clearly shows the overlap for predictors with a 0 and a 1 response respectively, for the Slugging Average Difference Predictor.
