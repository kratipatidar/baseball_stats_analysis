I believe I spent a great deal of time on understanding the dataset and various baseball metrics, and devoted time to just manipulating a specific set of baseball metrics, i.e., the batting statistics.

Using the pitching and fielding statistics is one way of adding information to the models and improving prediction results.

Another way would be getting rid of or modifying the predictors that hamper the analysis results, and do not add value to the model performance.
