When I first started off with my analysis, I created all my predictors separately for home and away teams. The correlation plot in such a predictor setting is illustrated below.

Since there was a lot of correlation between predictors such as XBH, TB and TOB, I proceeded to do a difference and ratio between the different predictors.

However, this did not entirely eliminate the correlation and there still remained some correlated predictors.

The yellow here represents some highly correlated predictors, with a correlation coefficient of close to 1.
