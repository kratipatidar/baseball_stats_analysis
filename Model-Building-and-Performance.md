Namely, 4 classification models were employed for determining the performance of the result on test set. An 80-20 train - test split was done for this purpose. 

|Model| Performance |
|-----|----------|
|Logistic Regression|0.539491|
|SVM Classifier|0.532963|
|Random Forest Classifier|0.53329|
|Naive Bayes Classifier|0.487598|

There was a slight improvement in performance in this case, as compared to the case where separate predictors were created for each of the away and home teams.
